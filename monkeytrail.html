                    <h3>MONKEY TRAIL</h3>
                    <p>Welcome to the Monkey Trail!</p>
                    <p>Can you handle it?</p>
                    <p>Test your skills in the all new Monkey Trail obstacle course! Hire a bicycle or bring your own and push yourself to the limits. Brave the rough terrain and cut sharp corners as you maneuver through the course. Race and challenge your friends and family and see who comes out on top. This attraction offers a fun and thrilling experience for those who are looking for it!</p>
                    <p>The Trail also offers many side paths for those who are not looking for the thrill of the obstacle course, but rather for a calm, pleasant walk with loved ones.</p>
                    <p>Please note:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Those who wish to take on the challenge of the obstacle course must be 15 years and older.</li>
                        <li>Children under the age of 15 should explore the Monkey Trail while walking under the safety of adult supervision.</li>
                        <li>Last (but certainly not least), please DO NOT feed the monkies.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</p>
                    <p>The Monkey Trail is directly opposite the Lost Forest</p>
