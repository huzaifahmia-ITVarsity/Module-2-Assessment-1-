                    <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                    <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes, a grouping known as paraphyletic; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regards to their scope.</p>
                    <p>Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World(Afro-Arabia) monkeys.</p>
                    <p>Lemurs, lorises, and galagos are not monkeys; instead they are strepsirrhine primates (suborder Strepsirrhini). The simians' sister group, the tarsiers, are also haplorhine primates; however, they are also not monkeys.</p>
                    <p>Monkeys, including apes, can be distinguished from other primates by having only two pectoral nipples, a pendulous penis, and a lack of sensory whiskers.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the Monkey at pen D12, just before the Northern Frontier, next to the Giraffe enclosure.</p>
